## Highlights

#### ðŸŽ¸ Customize the instrument

Choose between a  variety of instruments (from ukulele to  11-string guitar) and
tunings,  set  the  length  of  the fretboard,  and  switch  between  left-  and
right-handed fretting.

#### ðŸŽ¨ Overlay scales and arpeggios

The main feature  that distinguishes Fretboarder from other similar  apps is the
ability to  display several sequences  of notes on  the same fretboard.  You can
overlap scales  and arpeggios, display  their intersections and  select specific
positions on the neck.

#### ðŸ’» Use on any device

The UI has been designed to be simple and intuitive, and to work on both desktop
and mobile devices. Dark mode included!
